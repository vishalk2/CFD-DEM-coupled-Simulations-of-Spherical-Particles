### RESEARCH
1. Spouted Bed Dryer
   - Researched the Computational Fluid Dynamics – Discrete Element Method (CFD-DEM) coupling methods for simulating granular particles.
   - Constructed the Spouted Bed Dryer Simulation Model using ANSYS and implemented necessary meshing across the model.
   - Conducted CFD-DEM coupled simulations of spherical-shaped granular particles in a Spouted Bed Dryer using CFD-DEM solvers - OpenFOAM-5.x and LIGGGHTS.

2. Partially Averaged navier Stokes (PANS) vs Large Eddy Simulations (LES) for Turbulent Flows
   - Studied and implemented Partially Averaged Navier Stokes (PANS) model using OpenFOAM-5.x.
   - Implementation of PANS involved developing and validating numerical algorithms to simulate turbulent flows with improved accuracy and computational efficiency.
   - Applied numerical techniques to study and accurately capture the movements and interactions of the granular particles.
   - Effectively compared the results of PANS simulations against Large Eddy Simulation (LES) simulations, using Size & Velocity as parameters.
   - This comparative analysis provided valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations of different turbulence modelling approaches in predicting flow behaviour.
