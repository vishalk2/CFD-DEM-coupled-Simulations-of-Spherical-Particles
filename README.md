## CFD-DEM coupled simulations of Spherical-shaped particles in a Spouted Bed Dryer

# Research
1. Researched the Computational Fluid Dynamics â€“ Discrete Element Method (CFD-DEM) coupling methods for simulating granular particles.
2. Implemented Partially Averaged Navier Stokes (PANS) model using OpenFOAM-5.x.
3. Implmentation of PANS involved developing and validating numerical algorithms to simulate turbulent flows with improved accuracy and computational efficiency.
4. Conducted CFD-DEM coupled simulations of a Spouted Bed Dryer using CFD-DEM solvers, namely OpenFOAM-5.x and LIGGGHTS.
5. Applied numerical techniques to study and accurately capture the movements and interactions of the granular particles.
6. Effectively compared the results of PANS simulations against Large Eddy Simulation (LES) simulations, using Size & Velocity as parameters.
7. This comparative analysis provided valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations of different turbulence modelling approaches in predicting flow behaviour.
