### RESEARCH
- Researched the Computational Fluid Dynamics – Discrete Element Method (CFD-DEM) coupling methods for simulating granular particles.
- Constructed the Spouted Bed Dryer Simulation Model using ANSYS.
- Considered necessary node selection and implemented proper meshing across the Spouted Bed Dryer model.
- Conducted CFD-DEM coupled simulations of spherical-shaped granular particles in the Spouted Bed Dryer model using CFD-DEM solvers - OpenFOAM-5.x and LIGGGHTS.
- Simulated the behaviour of the particles across the Spouted Bed Dryer using their Size (Radius) and Velocity as parameters.
